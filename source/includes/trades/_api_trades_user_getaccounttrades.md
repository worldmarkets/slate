## GetAccountTrades

**Category:** User<br />**Permissions:** Operator, Trading, AccountReadOnly<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Requests the details on up to 200 past trade executions for a single specific account and Order Management System, starting at index *i*, where *i* is an integer identifying a specific execution in reverse order; that is, the most recent execution has an index of 0, and increments by one as trade executions recede into the past.

Users with Trading or AccountReadOnly permission may access trade information only for accounts with which they are associated; users with Operator permission may access trade information for any account.

The operator of the trading venue determines how long to retain an accessible trading history before archiving.
