## GetTickerHistory

**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Public<br />
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Requests a ticker history (high, low, open, close, volume, bid, ask, ID) of a specific instrument from a given date to the present. You will need to format the returned data per your requirements.

Because permission is Public, any user can retrieve the ticker history for any instrument on the OMS.

### Request

```json
{
	"InstrumentId": 1,
    "Interval": 60,
	"FromDate": "2018-07-18",
    "ToDate": "2018-07-19",
    "OMSId":1
}
```

| Key          | Value                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| InstrumentId | **integer.** The ID of a specific instrument. The current Order Management System is assumed. |
| Interval     | **integer.** The time between ticks, in seconds. For example, a value of 60 returns ticker array elements between *FromDate* to *ToDate* in 60-second increments.
| FromDate     | **string.** Oldest date from which the ticker history will start, in Micrisoft Ticks format. The report moves toward *ToDate* from this point. |
| ToDate       | **string.** Most recent date, at which the ticker history will end, in Microsoft Ticks format.  |
| OMSId        | **integer.** The ID of the Order Management System where the ticker history comes from.  |

### Response
