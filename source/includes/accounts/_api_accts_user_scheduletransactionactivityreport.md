**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading<br />
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Schedules a series of transaction activity reports for a list of accounts on a single Order Management System, starting at a specific date/time, and covering a specific time interval (90 days, for example). The reports run periodically until canceled.

Users with Trading permission can schedule transaction activity reports only for accounts with which they are associated; users with Operator permission can schedule transaction activity reports for any account.

Transaction Activity Reports are delivered in comma-separated-value (CSV) format. For specific CSV formatting information, see the A5S Extract CSV Data Dictionary, available from World Markets.
