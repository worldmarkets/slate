| RequestingUser    | **integer.** The User ID of the person requesting the trade activity report. This confirms the ID of the authenticated user who made the request by returning it as part of the response. |
| OMSId             | **integer.** The ID of the Order Management System on which the trade activity report will be run. |
| reportFlavor      | **enumerated string.** The type of report to be generated. One of:<br />TradeActivity<br />Transaction<br />Treasury<br /><br />The *reportFlavor* string confirms the nature of the call. |
| createTime        | **string.** The time and date on which the request for the trade activity report was made, in Microsoft Ticks format. |
| initialRunTime    | **string.**  The time and date at which the trade activity report was first run, in Microsoft Ticks format. |
| intervalStartTime | **string.** The start of the period that the report will cover, in Microsoft Ticks format. |
| intervalEndTime   | **string.** The end of the period that the report will cover, in Microsoft Ticks format. |

The call specifies a start time and an *intervalDuration*.<br /><br />For example, say that you schedule a weekly report with a 90-day *intervalDuration* value. *intervalDuration* represents the backward-looking period of the report. When the report runs again in a week’s time, it again looks back 90 days — but now those 90 days are offset by a week from the first report. |
