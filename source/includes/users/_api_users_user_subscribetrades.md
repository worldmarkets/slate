| 0 (TradeId)  | **integer.** The ID of this trade. |
| 1 (ProductPairCode) | **integer.** *ProductPairCode* is the same number and used for the same purpose as *InstrumentID*. The two are completely equivalent in value. InstrumentId 47 = ProductPairCode 47. |
| 2 (Quantity) | **real.** The quantity of the instrument traded. |
| 3 (Price) | **real.** The price at which the instrument traded. |
| 4 (Order1) | **integer.** The ID of the first order that resulted in the trade, either Buy or Sell. |
| 5 (Order2) | **integer.** The ID of the second order that resulted in the trade, either Buy or Sell. |
| 6 (Tradetime) | **long integer.** UTC trade time in Total Milliseconds. POSIX format. |
| 7 (Direction) | **integer.** Effect of the trade on the instrumentâ€™s market price. One of:<br />0 NoChange<br />1 UpTick<br />2 DownTick |
| 8 (TakerSide) | **integer.** Which side of the trade took liquidity? One of:<br />0 Buy<br />1 Sell<br /><br />The maker side of the trade provides liquidity by placing the order on the book (this can be a buy or a sell order). The other, taker, side takes the liquidity. It, too, can be buy-side or sell-side. |
| 9 (BlockTrade) | **Boolean.** Was this a privately negotiated trade that was reported to the OMS? A private trade returns 1 (*true*); otherwise 0 (*false*). Default is *false*. Block trades are not supported in exchange version 3.1 |
| 10 (order1ClientId or order2ClientId) | **integer.** The client-supplied order ID for the trade. Internal logic determines whether the program reports the *order1ClientId* or the *order2ClientId*. |
