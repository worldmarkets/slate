## SubscribeLevel1

**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading, Level1MarketData<br />
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Retrieves the latest Level 1 Ticker information and then subscribes the user to ongoing Level 1 market data event updates for one specific instrument. 

The **SubscribeLevel1** call responds with the Level 1 response shown below. The OMS then periodically sends in the same format as this response *Leve1UpdateEvent* information when best-bid/best-offer issue, until you send the **UnsubscribeLevel1** call.

Only a user with Operator permission can issue Level1MarketData permission using the call ***AddUserMarketDataPermission.**
