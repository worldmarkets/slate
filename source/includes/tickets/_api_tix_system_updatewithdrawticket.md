## UpdateWithdrawTicket

**Category:** System<br />**Permission:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Updates the contents of a single withdrawal ticket as identified by the value for *requestCode.*  The *requestCode* is the same value reported by **GetWithdraws** (where it is called *withdrawCode*). All other values of the withdrawal ticket can be changed by a user with Operator permission.

The values for *Comments* and *Attachments* are arrays. The values for *Comments* and *Attachments* can be added to using:

- **AddWithdrawTicketAttachment**
- **SubmitWithdrawTicketComment**

You cannot delete a comment or an attachment.
