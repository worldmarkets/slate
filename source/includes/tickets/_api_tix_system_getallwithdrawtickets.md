## GetAllWithdrawTickets

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Returns an array of all withdrawal tickets from the specified Order Management System. All withdrawal tickets from all accounts and all users are returned from the start of the Exchange to the present, subject only to the restrictions set by the *StartIndex* and *Limit* values.

The user must have Operator permission to issue **GetAllWithdrawTickets.** A similar call, **GetWithdrawTickets** can be used with Operator or Trading permissions, and returns withdraw tickets from a single account.

### Request

```json
{
    "OMSId": 1,
    "OperatorId": 1,
    "StartIndex": 0,
    "Limit": 1
}
```

The key-value pairs *StartIndex* and *Limit* are optional. The oldest ticket is ticket *0*. This differs from other calls where the newest ticket or transaction is *0.* The value of *StartIndex* is a pointer into the stream of withdrawal tickets, and the value of *Limit* shows how far into the past (towards ticket *0*) to return tickets. For example, if there are 1500 current tickets (oldest ticket *0* through newest ticket *1499*), *StartIndex* = 100, and *Limit* = 100; then **GetAllWithdrawTickets** would return ticket numbers 1399 through 1300.

| Key        | Value                                                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OMSId      | **integer.** REQUIRED The ID of the Order Management System where the withdraw tickets were created. |
| OperatorId | **integer.** REQUIRED The ID of the admin (operator) requesting **GetAllWithdrawTickets.** |
| StartIndex | **integer.** OPTIONAL The location in the series of withdrawal tickets at which to begin returning tickets. Tickets are returned from that location towards ticket *0* (the oldest ticket). If you do not include a *StartIndex* key and value in the request, all tickets will be returned (subject to the value of *Limit*.) |
| Limit      | **integer.** OPTIONAL The count of withdrawal tickets you want returned. For example, if you set the value of *Limit* to 50, a maximum of 50 withdrawal tickets will be returned. That maximum may be further restricted by the position of *StartIndex.* For example, if your *StartIndex* is only ten tickets from ticket *0*, and you include a *Limit* value of 50, you're still only going to get ten tickets. |
