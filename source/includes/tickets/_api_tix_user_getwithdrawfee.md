## GetWithdrawFee

**Category:** User<br />**Permissions:** Operator, Trading, Withdraw<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Gets an estimate of a fee for a withdrawal. The Products function of the World Markets  Admin can set withdraw fees OMS-wide. You can also set a withdraw fee programmatically using **SetOMSFee,** but **SetOMSFee** is a System (not User) call with permission reserved to an exchange operator. Exchange-wide withdrawal fees cannot be overridden.

A user with Trading or Withdraw permissions can obtain withdrawal fee estimates only for products and accounts with which the user is associated; a user with Operator permission can obtain withdrawal fee estimates for any product or account.
