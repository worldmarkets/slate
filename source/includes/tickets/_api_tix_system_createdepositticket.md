**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator, Trading<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

**CreateDepositTicket** records a deposit ticket for deposits of fiat money (non-crypto national currencies, for example). Crypto-currencies, such as BitCoin or Monero are handled by a different deposit mechanism described in **GetDepositInfo.**

The ticketing mechanism of the Order Management System tracks deposits and withdrawals, interacting with the Asset Manager.

| Key                 | Value                                                        |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| assetManagerId      | **integer.** The ID of the system's asset manager module, usually 1. |

| assetId             | **integer.** The ID of the asset being deposited. An asset is functionally the same as a product; you can obtain a list of products/assets available on the Exchange by using **GetProducts.** |
| assetName           | **string.** The short name of the asset being deposited. For example, USD (US Dollars) or BTC (BitCoin). |
| amount              | **real.** The quantity of the asset being deposited. This is not the monetary value of the asset. For example, 2.5 BitCoins is 2.5. |
| omsId               | **integer.** The ID of the Order Management System where the deposit is being made, usually 1. |
| requestCode         | **string.** A *requestCode* is a globally unique ID assigned by the system. Leave the value for this string null when issuing the **CreateDepositTicket** call; the Response returns the value for the *requestCode,* which you may need for other calls. |
| requestIp           | **string.** The IP address from which the calling user makes the deposit ticket request. |
| requestUser         | **integer.** The user ID of the user making the deposit ticket request. |
| requestUserName     | **string.** The user name of the user making the deposit ticket request, for example, jsmith. |
| operatorId          | **integer.** The ID of the trading venue operator.           |
| status              | **integer.** The current status of the deposit, stated as a number. A new deposit will always have a status of 0. |
| feeAmt              | **real.** The amount of any fee for the deposit.     |
| updatedByUser       | **integer.** If the deposit ticket has been updated, this field contains the user ID of the user who updated the ticket. Because **CreateDepositTicket** creates the ticket, it is unlikely to have been updated yet; this value should be 0. |
| updatedByUserName   | **string.** If the deposit ticket has been updated, this field contains the name of the user who updated the ticket. Because **CreateDepositTicket** creates the ticket, it is unlikely to have been updated yet; this value should be an empty string (null). |
| ticketNumber        | **long integer.** A number assigned by the calling user to identify this deposit ticket, much as a purchase order identifies an order. |
| depositInfo         | **object.** Leave this string as empty: "&nbsp;". |
| createdTimeStamp    | **string.** The time and date stamp for when the deposit ticket was created, in Microsoft Ticks format. All time and date stamps are given as UTC. |
| lastUpdateTimeStamp | **string.** The time and date stamp for the last update to the deposit ticket after it was created. Because **CreateDepositTicket** creates the ticket, it is unlikely that it has been updated, and this string should be empty. |
| comments            | **string.** Any comments appended to the deposit ticket.     |
| attachments         | **string.** Any attachments appended to the deposit ticket.  |
           |
