## GetAllDepositTickets

**Category:** System<br />**Permissions:** Operator<br />**Call Type:** Synchronous

Returns an array of all deposit tickets on the specified Order Management System. All deposit tickets from all accounts and all users are returned from the start of the Exchange to the present, subject only to the restrictions set by the *StartIndex* and *Limit* values.

Only a user with Operator permission can issue **GetAllDepositTickets.**

### Request

```json
{
    "OMSId": 1,
    "OperatorId": 1,
    "StartIndex": 0,
    "Limit": 0
}
```

The values for *OMSId* and *OperatorId* are required; the key-value pairs *StartIndex* and *Limit* are optional. You can include *StartIndex*, *Limit,* or both.

| Key            | Value                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| OMSId          | **integer.** REQUIRED The ID of the Order Management System on which the deposit tickets were created. |
| OperatorId     | **integer.** REQUIRED The user ID of the user with Operator permission who is issuing the **GetAllDepositTickets** call. |
| StartIndex     | **integer.** OPTIONAL The earliest location in the series of deposit tickets at which to begin returning tickets. Tickets are returned from that location forward (that is, from then toward now). The most recent deposit ticket is ticket 0. If you do not include a *StartIndex* key and value in your request, tickets from the beginning of the Exchange will be returned (subject to *Limit.*) |
| Limit          | **integer.** OPTIONAL The count of deposit tickets you want returned. For example, if you set the value of *Limit* to 50, a maximum of 50 deposit tickets will be returned. That maximum may be further restricted by the position of *StartIndex.* For example, if your *StartIndex* is only ten tickets back, and you include a *Limit* value of 50, you're still only going to get ten tickets. |
