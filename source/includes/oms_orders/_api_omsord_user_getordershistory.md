## GetOrdersHistory

**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading<br />
**Call Type:** Synchronous

Retrieves an array of multiple orders (hence, **GetOrdersHistory** with plural *Orders*) for the specified account, order ID, user, instrument, or time stamp. The history starts at index *i*, where *i* is an integer identifying a specific order (the most recent order has an index of 0). “Depth” is the count of trades to report backwards from *startIndex*. All values in the call other than *OMSId* are optional.

For example, if *depth* = 200 and *startIndex* = 0, the history returns 200 orders into the past starting with the most recent (0) order. If *depth* = 200 and *startIndex* = 100, the history returns 200 orders into the past starting at 100 orders in the past.

The owner of the trading venue determines how long to retain order history before archiving.

A user with Trading permission can retrieve a history only for accounts with which the user is associated; a user with Operator permission can retrieve a history for any user or account.

<aside class="notice"><strong>Note:</strong> In this call, "Depth" refers to the count of trades to report, not the depth of the order book.</aside>

| depth                 | **integer**. In this case, the count of orders to return, counting from the *StartIndex*. If not specified, returns all orders between *BeginTimeStamp* and *EndTimeStamp*, beginning at *StartIndex* and working backwards. |
| startIndex            | **integer**. The starting index into the order history, from 0 (the most recent trade) and moving backwards in time. If not specified, defaults to 0. |
