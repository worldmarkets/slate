## SendOrder

**Category:** User<br />
**Permissions:** Operator, Trading<br />
**Call Type:** Asynchronous

Creates an order. 

Anyone submitting an order should also subscribe to the various market data and event feeds, or call **GeOpenOrders** or **GetOrderStatus** to monitor the status of the order. If the order is not in a state to be executed, **GetOpenOrders** will not return it.

A user with Trading permission can create an order only for those accounts and instruments with which the user is associated; a user with Operator permissions can create an order for any account and instrument.

| Key                | Value                                                        |

| TimeInForce        | **integer.** An integer that represents the period during which the new order is executable.

If order B executes, then order A created by this call is canceled. You can also set up order B to watch order A in the same way, but that may require an update to order B to make it watch this one, which could have implications for priority in the order book. See **CancelReplaceOrder** and **ModifyOrder.** |

| PegPriceType       | **integer.** When entering a stop/trailing order, set *PegPriceType* to an integer that corresponds to the type of price that pegs the stop:<br />**1** Last<br />**2** Bid<br />**3** Ask<br />**4** Midpoint |
